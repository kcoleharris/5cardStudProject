CHANGE1
*each hand evaluation assigns a value to $t3: highcard ($t3 --> 0)
					     pair ($t3 --> 1)
					     TwoPair ($t3 --> 2)
					     ThreeOfAKind ($t3 -->3)
					     Straight ($t3 --> 5)
Therefore the following were added in order to facilitate in comparing hands:
	FourOfAKind ($t3 -->4)
	FullHouse ($t3 -->4.5)
	Flush ($t3 -->6)
	StraightFlush ($t3 -->7)
	RoyalFlush ($t3 -->8)
____________________________________________________________________________________
CHANGE2
added an array to store the various player hand types ($t3)
	line 23 --> storedHands: .word 0:2 #for two player game
____________________________________________________________________________________
CHANGE3
* "b exit" after hand determinations to end the game

This was changed to go store the value associated with the hand type ($t3).
	CHANGED TO: b storeForComparison
____________________________________________________________________________________
CHANGE4
added code "storeForComparison" (line 355)
	   "preStoreHandType" (line 522)
	   "storeHandType" (line 526)
	   "compareHands" (line 361)
	   "higherHand" (line 532)
	   "equalHands" (line 541)
____________________________________________________________________________________
NOTE:
New two player code flow will follow the following outline:
	------------ROUND LOOP-------------
	---------PLAYER TURN LOOP----------
	exchange/keep cards (actaul gameplay)
	handEvaluation (obtain a $t3 value)
	storeHandType (store $t3) [loop1 -->store player1$t3 ; loop2 -->store player2$t3]
		-would continue for 2+ player
	-------------END PT LOOP-------------	
	higherHand (compare t3's to determine winner of round)

added comments where loop counters and braching statements should go
	line 60 -->round loop start
	line 61 -->player turn loop start
	line 359 -->add player loop counter
	line 360 -->player turn loop end
	line 364 -->add loop round counter 
	line 365 -->round loop end
	-------------END R LOOP-------------
